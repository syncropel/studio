# Syncropel Studio

Welcome to **Syncropel Studio**, the official web and desktop UI for the **Syncropel platform**. This repository contains the source code for a modern, interactive notebook-style interface for the `cx` engine. It enables visual workflow authoring, live data exploration, and intelligent automation in a single, cohesive environment.

This application is built with **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **Mantine UI**, and is packaged as a cross-platform desktop application using **Electron**.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture: The Brain and The Glass

Syncropel Studio is the "Glass" for the headless `cx-shell` engine, the "Brain." It follows a robust, decoupled client-server architecture:

1.  **The Engine (`cx-server`):** A powerful, stateful Python backend that executes all commands, manages the workspace, and provides the computational power. It is a required dependency for this project.
2.  **The UI (This Repository):** A React/Next.js single-page application that provides a rich, interactive user experience. It is a "thin client" that renders state and sends commands to the engine.
3.  **The Communication Layer:** The UI communicates with the engine in real-time over a secure WebSocket connection.
4.  **The Desktop Shell (Electron):** An Electron wrapper packages the UI and the engine together into a single, easy-to-install desktop application, creating a seamless "it just works" experience for end-users.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Development)

To run the application in a local development environment, you will need two separate terminal sessions.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v20 or later) and **npm**.
- A complete, working development setup of the **[`syncropel/cx-shell`](https://github.com/syncropel/cx-shell)** repository.

### Step 1: Run the Backend Server

In your first terminal, start the `cx-server` from your local `cx-shell` repository.

```bash
# Navigate to your cx-shell repository
cd /path/to/your/cx-shell

# Activate its virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the local server
cx serve
```

The server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8888`.

### Step 2: Run the Frontend UI

In your second terminal, start the Next.js development server.

```bash
# Navigate to this repository (studio)
cd /path/to/your/studio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at **http://localhost:3000**. Open this URL in your web browser. The UI should connect to the `cx-server` automatically.

## üì¶ Building the Production Application

To build the final, distributable desktop application (`.dmg`, `.exe`, etc.), use the `electron:build` script.

**Important:** This process is designed to be run in a CI/CD environment that injects the pre-compiled `cx-server` executable. For local builds, you must manually place the `cx` executable in a `./resources` directory at the root of this project.

```bash
# 1. (Locally) Create a resources directory and copy the backend executable
mkdir -p ./resources
cp /path/to/your/cx-shell/dist/cx ./resources/cx-server

# 2. Then, build the Electron application
npm run electron:build
```

The final installers will be located in the `dist/` directory.
